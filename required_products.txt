# PadoGrid bundle environment. This bundle requires the product versions listed below.
# Note that the required product versions listed in the file override the product
# versions that make up the bundle name.
#
# Specify ony the version number parts that are required. For example, if the bundle
# can be run on all versions of SnappyData 1.x.x, then specify 1 only. If it applies to
# 1.2.x, then 1.2. If the bundle applies to multiple specific versions, then list them
# comma-separated. For example, the following applies to SnappyData 1.1.1 and 1.2.x
#
# snappydata=1.1.1,1.2
#
# To deemphasize products, i.e., product not required, requires multiple products, etc.,
# then set none=1.
